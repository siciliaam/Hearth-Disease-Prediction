Hearth Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using the "Klasifikasi Penyakit Jantung" dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, resting electrocardiographic results, heart rate, and more, which are used to predict the presence of heart disease (target). After cleaning and preprocessing the data, a logistic regression model is trained to classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on the selected features. The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 82%, with precision, recall, and F1-score balanced between the classes. A correlation heatmap was also generated to visualize relationships between features. The project demonstrates a straightforward approach to medical prediction, showcasing the use of machine learning for heart disease diagnosis.
